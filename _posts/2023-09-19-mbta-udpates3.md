Let me explain what has happened... no, there is too much, let me sum up.  The Working Group is done; now the ARB is writing the actual warrant articles in the next two weeks to submit to Special Town Meeting.  There is very little chance for the average citizen to make substantiative changes at this point, without understanding how warrant motions work at STM.

## What's Happening Now?

The ARB [met recently Monday 18-September](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/Home/Components/Calendar/Event/32580/) to continue updating their warrant articles.  *This page will be updated once meeting minutes or other reports are available.*

ARB meets again [Monday 2-October](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/Home/Components/Calendar/Event/32581/) to make any final adjustments or recommendations on any zoning articles to be submitted to STM.  Once their and any other town board recommendations are ready, the official warrant will be posted.

*After that*, it's up to Town Meeting Members to propose whatever other substitute or similar motions for submitted warrant articles.

Special Town Meeting [starts 17-October](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/town-governance/town-meeting), and given the number of articles and passion about these issues, will likely take several sessions.  Town Meeting members will have a chance to vote on all warrant articles, however history shows that articles with town board approvals (from Select board or ARB) will often be passed.

## The ARB Is Writing Multiple Zoning Warrant Articles

After the ARB's 11-Sep giant [meeting to review the WG report and deal with public comment](https://menotomymatters.com/townhall/mbta-udpates2/), the ARB and (presumably) the town planning department have been busy writing individual draft warrant articles for STM.  The Working Group could only recommend plans; what actually appears before STM is up to the ARB to write.  Much of this process will be done by the ARB itself with limited public comment.  Those familiar with Town Meeting procedures will obviously have opportunities to try submitting substitute motions or the like later.

This file *230906_MBTAC_zoning_articl.pdf* is currently identical to the WG's recommended bylaw changes edited 6-Sep, although the filename has changed.  However this does not specify which alternative map version from the WG is being used.
