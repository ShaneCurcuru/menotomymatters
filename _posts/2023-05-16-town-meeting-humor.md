Reviewing [Town Meeting 2023 records](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/town-governance/town-meeting) I read the detailed official voting records of each session.  Much to my surprise, I saw votes on right triangles in Euclidian space?  What?  Redefining geometry itself seems like a bit of a stretch for Arlington TMM members, although little would surprise me there.

## Arlington Votes On Free Speech, Triangles, Stenography

Did you know that Arlington's official town meeting vote summaries includes these questions?

1. Will the Town Meeting finish in five nights? *(motion fails: Yes: 101, No: 102, Abstain: 11)*
2. Do you enjoy discussing budgets? *(motion passes: Yes: 122, No: 71, Abstain: 19)*
3. Are there more precincts in Arlington than [keys] on a stenographic keyboard?  *(motion passes, even though it's not true: Yes: 99, No: 87, Abstain: 21)*
4. I support free speech for people I disagree with.  *(motion passes: Yes: 202, No: 7, Abstain: 13)*
5. The square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides in a Euclidian 2-space. *(motion passes: Yes: 143, No: 81, Abstain: 0)*
6. Tonight will be the final night of 2023 annual town meeting.  *(motion passes: Yes: 193, No: 8, Abstain: 2)*

At first I thought this was someone in the IT department checking to see if anyone actually reads the [Electronic Voting Reports](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/65331/638188078158030000).  But I realized these are just the test votes used to ensure that the remote keypads each TMM uses to vote on articles is working.

- Start with the [Massachusetts Moderators Association](https://massmoderators.org/for-the-public/), which publishes the de facto guides to how TMMs actually work.
- Wikipedia has a surprisingly [detailed article discussing how different states do TM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_meeting).
- New England Historical Society tracks the [oldest town meetings by state](https://newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/oldest-town-meeting-6-states/), where of course Plymouth claims the first (although Dorchester had a claim too).  Who knew it wasn't until 1715 that the Commonwealth started requiring TM to elect a moderator!
- [Early Menotomy / Northwest Cambridge town meetings](https://arlingtonhistorical.org/town-meetings-in-the-northwest-precinct-of-cambridge-1736-1795/) are cataloged at the Arlington Historical Society.
- [Real Democracy: New England Town Meeting And How It Works](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo3641466.html) is a scholarly investigation of how TMM actually works over three decades across New England.
