The MBTA Communities Working Group (WG) has been covering a lot of ground in recent meetings, and it's hard to keep track of what the most recent decisions are.  Thankfully several Arlington residents have been taking detailed unofficial minutes of meetings lately.  To help folks understand the context of different meetings, we've arranged all the information about each meeting together here.

## September 11th Arlington Redevelopment Board Hearing

The ARB plans to review recommendations from the WG at their [normal 11-September meeting](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/Home/Components/Calendar/Event/32574/264?backlist=%2ftown-governance%2fboards-and-committees%2fredevelopment-board), so expect a lot of changes and finalizations in the next couple of weeks.
