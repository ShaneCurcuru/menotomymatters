Plenty of changes have been discussed and decided at recent WG meetings.  While official meeting minutes take time to post, several helpful Arlingtonians have been collecting materials at meetings or making public records requests to get the latest scoop!

## Updated Zoning Regulations Details

The final [*draft* language of the specific Zoning changes](/assets/docs/DraftZoningRegulation_MBTA_Communities_08172023.pdf) *(PDF, 4pp)* the WG plans to send to the ARB - and then to Town Meeting - is now available.  While reading Zoning regulations requires a lot of patience, these specific proposed regulations give a good sense of what to expect at TMM.

## New Alternative 1 Maps And Compliance Worksheet

The WG has come up with two alternative maps to consider sending to the ARB, and is also reportedly in the process of sending both maps and compliance worksheets to the state, to **test** if they would be acceptable to the state to comply with the law.  Here are the two alternatives being proposed (with a decision not yet made).

**Alternative 1** has five districts with an extended Heights district stretching towards Lexington, and a total of 7,391 total unit capacity.

## New Alternative 2 Maps And Compliance Worksheet

This is the second alternative set of maps the WG is reportedly considering.

**Alternative 2** has four districts, dropping the extension in the Heights, and a total of 6,766 total unit capacity.
