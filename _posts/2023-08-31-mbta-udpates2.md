**NEW!** Read the [latest updates on MBTA Communities](https://menotomymatters.com/townhall/mbta-udpates3/?up)!
{: .notice--warning}

Plenty of changes have been discussed and decided at recent WG meetings.  While official meeting minutes take time to post, several helpful Arlingtonians have been collecting materials at meetings or making public records requests to get the latest scoop!

## ARB Meeting 11-September Discussed Changes

The ARB had a **long** meeting to discuss their regular agenda as well as the WG report, including *dozens* public comments in person and many more via email.

## WG Final Comprehensive Report

The [WG issued a 51 page report](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/66621/638295974594270000) detailing their process, the surveys, all the various map versions, and the decisions made during the process.  This is a must-read for anyone wishing to understand how the town has approached and worked on this process.
## Updated Zoning Regulations Details

The final [Working Group's proposed Zoning Bylaw Amendment](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/66579/638296112612334760) *(PDF, 4pp, official town document updated 6-Sep)* is now available.  This document will be discussed at the 11-Sep ARB meeting to get the final language ready, and for the ARB to provide a recommendation to Special Town Meeting. While reading Zoning regulations requires a lot of patience, these specific proposed regulations give a good sense of what to expect at TMM.

## New Guidance On MBTA Communities Compliance

On 17-August, the state EOHLC issued an [updated Compliance Guidelines Memo](https://www.mass.gov/doc/summary-of-changes-to-mbta-communities-guidelines-081723/download) that lays out more specific criteria that final plans must meet.  This memo lays out several ways that communities with "village-style or downtown" districts can amend their plans to find ways to include more ground-level non-residential components in various ways.  The EOHLC aslo includes a list of several state grant programs that may be used or may be valuable when complying with the law. 

On 29-August, [Arlington's Director of planning, Claire Ricker](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/departments/planning-community-development), issued a memo about [Updated MBTA Communities Guidelines](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/66581) with specific explanations of how updates affect Arlington.  In general, the recent state updates and additional grant programs are reported to work well with the existing plans the WG is proposing.

## New Alternative 1 Maps And Compliance Worksheet

The WG has come up with two alternative maps to send to the ARB, and is also reportedly in the process of sending both maps and compliance worksheets to the state, to **test** if they would be acceptable to the state to comply with the law.  Here are the two alternatives being proposed (with a decision not yet made).

**Alternative 1** has five districts with an extended Heights district stretching towards Lexington, and a total of 7,391 total unit capacity.  The **FINAL PDF of the [Alternative 1 Map Plan](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/66583/638290929702230000)** is posted, including [GIS shape data files](https://arlingtonma-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/jenniferjs_town_arlington_ma_us/EVLGZnEmcyhGlmlpAUetBDIBmvMM_6QJS-IgDtaCbFUe4g?e=UC2hv7).
