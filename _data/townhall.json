The Board of Health is a statutory board comprised of three community members at large appointed by the Town Manager for three year terms. One member of the Board of Health must be a physician, and a chairperson is elected annually. The Health Department is a professionally staffed office within the Town of Arlington’s Department of Health and Human Services consisting of a Director, administrative staff, and health inspectors (Health Compliance Officers).  \nThe Board of Health holds monthly public meetings and conducts public hearings as necessary; often times the Board functions in a quasi-judicial manner to adjudicate hearings for health code violations. Generally speaking, the Board adopts Regulations that provide protections beyond the minimum standards outlined in the Massachusetts General Laws (M.G.L.)and State Sanitary Code (codified in the Code of Massachusetts Regulations, C.M.R.) and sets town-wide policy related to important health issues, while the Health Department handles day-to-day procedural operations, administrative duties, and executes the various health laws and regulations. The Health Department may also be delegated as the enforcing authority for Town bylaws passed by Town Meeting, the municipal equivalent of the legislature. The Health Department, in broad terms, also works to prevent and control communicable diseases and promote a healthy community, among other things.  \n\nThe Board, through the Health Department, provides inspectional services aimed at protecting the public and environmental health. Such inspectional service resources are directed at retail food safety, safe and sanitary housing, recreational camps for children, bathing beaches, public and semi-public swimming pools, tanning facilities, bodyart, bodywork, hazardous waste disposal etc. The Board, also through its Health Department, provides various vaccinations to the community, the most popular of which are flu and pneumonia vaccines.   \n\nThe Board of Health and Health Department are funded primarily by the Town of Arlington’s operating budget, which is comprised mainly of funds obtained from local property taxes, but is augmented by local aid from the State of Massachusetts. The Health Department also periodically receives grant funding, mostly from the Federal government, for specific projects or topics of interest. In addition to the funding sources described above, the Health Department generates revenue by charging permit fees which offset the cost of delivering the aforementioned inspectional services."

The original charge of the group was to support and promote activities and projects that ensure healthy youth development, services when needed, and opportunities to celebrate and engage Arlington’s young people.  Over the years, the Board of Youth Services (BYS) has been involved in several initiatives that have become town traditions that continue to exist today, such as Town Day, the Arlington High School’s Last Blast, Thanksgiving Basket food drive, and Holiday Help.  The BYS has maintained a steadfast commitment to this mission, with an active community presence for the past five decades.  \n\nIn recent years, the Arlington Y  \n\nThe BYS is comprised of 11 committed volunteers, each of whom brings unique professional experiences and interests, and who share a passion for and commitment to children and to the Town of Arlington.  BYS openings and official notices are posted on the town website.  Interested community members are encouraged to apply to be considered for membership.

    "description": "The Select Board at a meeting held on May 4, 1981 voted to establish a Budget Revenue Task Force as part of the strategy to deal with the Proposition 2 1/2, to coordinate budget issues and recommendations to improve communications relative to various revenue matters. The Task Force consists of the Chairman of the Select Board or his designee, the Town Treasurer or his designee; the Chairman of  the Finance Committee or his designee; the Chairman of the School Committee or his designee; the Superintendent of Schools and the Town Manager or his designee.  \nThe Task Force meets prior to any Budget recommendations to discuss and examine the actual funds available.

    "description": "  \nArticle 46 of the Town Meeting of 1919 asked the town to accept sections 21 to 25 inclusive chapter 78 of the revised laws of Mass. Relating to the election and establishment of boards of cemetery commissioners. The next article sought the vote of the town in electing a board of commissioners. The next article sought the vote of the town in electing a board of cemetery commissioners consisting of three persons. They set forth the Rules and Regulations for Mt. Pleasant Cemetery and the Old Burying Ground. Cemetery Commission meetings are held in the Mt. Pleasant Cemetery Chapel on the second Wednesday of each month at 9 a.m. The public is welcome. Please check the event calendar to the right for upcoming meetings.  \nPerhaps the site that offers us the greatest tangible reminder of this past is the Old Burying Ground, tucked away behind the First Parish Unitarian Church in the center of town. It is here that the names and stories of generations past are etched in stone. Early Puritan settlers had been living and working in the village of Menotomy for almost 100 years before a burying place was designated in 1724.   \nBy the 1840s lack of space in the Old Burying Ground forced the town to establish a new cemetery. The new cemetery (named Mount Pleasant in 1846) was dedicated on June 14, 1843 by the Reverend David Damon, pastor of the Congregational Society. Shortly after the dedication, he suffered an attack of apoplexy and died just days later. Ironically, he was the first person interred in the new cemetery he had dedicated.  \n\n<a href='/departments/public-works/mt-pleasant-cemetery/monthly-cemetery-stats'>Monthly Cemetery Statistics</a>"

The Committee will make a recommendation on which firm to select based on the qualityand relevance of the proposals and interviews. Once a firm is selected, the Committee will work with the firm throughout thefeasibility phase and will be expected to consider the cost/benefits of the options that are presented within the final report. TheCommittee will begin meeting in July and should be prepared to make final recommendations to the Capital Planning Committeein the fall. The expectation is that the Committee will meet twice a month.The Committee should include stakeholders that will have varying degrees of input throughout the initial stages of feasibilitythrough actual design and construction. The composition of the Committee should include individuals with expertise in seniorservices, design and construction and finance. I request that the ARB consider that the Committee’s membership includes thefollowing:• Member of the Arlington Redevelopment Board• Director of Planning & Community Development• Deputy Town Manager• Health & Human Services Director• Director of Facilities• Council on Aging Executive Director• Member of the Council on Aging• Member of the Arlington Senior Association• Member of the Permanent Town Building Committee• 2 Members of the Capital Planning Committee  "

    "description": "The Select Board voted on July 16, 2018 to establish a Clean Energy Future Committee (CEFC).  The mission of the CEFC is to guide the Town of Arlington to a future where, by 2050, net emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases attributable to all sources in Town are zero. The Committee shall identify short and long-term energy goals; facilitate research studies, projects and collaborations; enlist the support of residents and businesses; recommend changes to laws and regulations; seek state and local funding; and take any other actions necessary for Arlington to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.  \n#### Net Zero Planning  \nThe CEFC is currently developing a Net Zero Plan to guide Arlington to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Work began in early 2019 and the final plan is scheduled for completion by December 31, 2020. Arlington is partnering with the City of Melrose, Town of Natick and the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) on a joint project to develop greenhouse gas inventories and net zero plans for all three communities. Further details on this joint planning project are available on<a href='https://www.mapc.org/resource-library/planning-for-net-zero-by-2050/'>MAPC’s website</a> , or by contacting Arlington Energy Manager Ken Pruitt at 781-316-3428 or<a href='mailto:kpruitt@town.arlington.ma.us'>kpruitt@town.arlington.ma.us</a> .  \n#### Proposed Prohibition on Fossil Fuel Infrastructure in New Construction and Major Renovations  \nThe CEFC supports a prohibition on fossil fuel infrastructure in new construction and major renovations because it would help Arlington achieve the Town’s goal of reducing carbon pollution to net zero by 2050. A major focus of the Net Zero Plan being developed by the CEFC (see above on this page) is to reduce or eliminate the combustion of carbon-intensive fossil fuels for heating and transportation. The CEFC, in concert with Sustainable Arlington and Mothers Out Front, is advocating for a new Town bylaw that would prohibit fossil fuel infrastructure in new construction and major renovations. The bylaw is being modeled on a similar measure adopted by Brookline’s Town Meeting in November 2019, and available on the<a href='https://www.brooklinema.gov/DocumentCenter/View/20106/November-19-2019-Special-Town-Meeting-Warrant'>Town of Brookline’s website (it is Article 21)</a>    \nIt is anticipated that this measure will be on the warrant for an upcoming Town Meeting, but the exact timing is unknown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A public information session on this warrant article was held on Thursday February 27.<a href='https://acmi.tv/videos/public-information-session-on-fossil-fuel-warrant-article-february-27-2020/'>ACMi recorded the information session, and the recording is now available on </a> <a href='https://acmi.tv/videos/public-information-session-on-fossil-fuel-warrant-article-february-27-2020/'> </a> <a href='https://acmi.tv/videos/public-information-session-on-fossil-fuel-warrant-article-february-27-2020/'>their website.</a>   \nThere are effective and affordable alternatives to heating systems fueled by natural gas, oil or propane. Modern cold climate heat pumps provide both heating and cooling without on-site combustion of fossil fuels. They can heat both small and large spaces, as well as domestic hot water. For example, Arlington’s new High School will be heated exclusively with heat pumps. More information on heat pumps and other clean heating technologies is available at<a href='http://wepowr.com/heatsmartaw/'>Arlington’s HeatSmart campaign website</a> .  \nFor more information on the proposed bylaw, contact Ken Pruitt, Energy Manager, at 781-316-3428 or<a href='kpruitt@town.arlington.ma.us'>kpruitt@town.arlington.ma.us</a> ."

    "description": "#### 2021 Final CPA Application   \n#### Community Preservation Act Committee  \nArlington voters approved adoption of the Community Preservation Act (CPA) in November 2014 with the Act to begin funding in FY2016. The Town of Arlington began collecting surcharge revenue on the August 3, 2015 tax bills and will continue collection on a quarterly basis.The act will raise an estimated $1.5 million in funding annually via a tax surcharge and state funds that are designated for major public investments in open space and outdoor recreational facilities, affordable housing, and historic preservation. The Community Preservation Act Committee, required by the CPA under MGL Chapter 44B, and formed by Town Meeting, is tasked with evaluating Arlington's needs in those three specific areas and making recommendations to Town Meeting on how CPA funding should be spent.The committee consists of nine volunteers, including four members from the general public and a member from each of the following bodies: the Redevelopment Board, the Conservation Commission, the Historical Commission, the Parks and Recreation Commission, and the Housing Authority.\r\nCommittee members serve three-year terms, but initial appointments to the committee have been staggered to (1) one-year term position, two (2) two-year term positions, and one (1) three-year term position.  \n#### Community Preservation Act Committee Reports to Town Meeting  \n<a href='/home/showdocument?id=45958'>2019 Report to Town Meeting</a>  (updated 4/24 to include images)<a href='/home/showdocument?id=41702'>2018 Report to Town Meeting</a> <a href='/home/showdocument?id=43287'>2017 Report to Town Meeting</a> <a href='/home/showdocument?id=32426'>2016 Report to Special Town Meeting</a>   \n#### Helpful Links  \n<a href='https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleVII/Chapter44B'>For more information on CPA Legislation, click here.</a> <a href='https://www.arlingtonma.gov/town-governance/laws-and-regulations/town-bylaws/title-ii-committees-and-commissions'>For more information on Arlington's CPA Bylaw,  click here.</a> <a href='http://www.communitypreservation.org/DOR-Allowable-Uses-2012.pdf'>To view the Department of Revenue's CPA Allowable Spending Chart, click here.</a> More information about the CPA surcharge can be found on the<a href='/home/showdocument?id=29677'>Assessor's CPA page</a> .

    "description": "The Arlington Conservation  \nConservation Commissioners work to ensure that all construction and development projects (residential, municipal, and commercial) that may alter any wetlands, floodplains, rivers, streams, ponds and/or lakes are in permitted compliance with state and local wetland regulations. The Conservation Commission also protects and manages the Town’s Conservation Lands.  \nIf you have questions about the environmental resource areas that fall under the Commission's jurisdiction, please review the<a href='/home/showdocument?id=48634'>Living in Environmental Resource Areas</a> guide. Any work within 100 feet of a wetland, lake, or pond, within 200 feet of a river or stream, or within the 100-year floodplain must receive prior approval from the Commission. Not sure if your property is within conservation jurisdiction? Refer to the Town's interactive<a href='https://www.mapsonline.net/arlingtonma/wetland.html'>wetlands and floodplain map</a> to determine if your project needs conservation approval.The Conservation Commission usually meets the first and third Thursdays of each month in the 2nd floor conference room, Town Hall Annex, 730 Massachusetts Avenue, beginning at 7:30 p.m.  Meetings are open to the public and agendas for meetings are posted on the Town Website.<a href='/home/showdocument?id=34810'>A description of meeting agenda items as well as corresponding rules is available to assist those attending a Commission meetings.</a>  <a href='https://www.arlingtonma.gov/town-governance/all-boards-and-committees/conservation-commission/agendas-minutes'> Corresponding Minutes can be viewed along with the Agenda on the Minutes and Agenda section of our webpage. </a> Information for filing an application for such approval (a Request for Determination of Applicability, Notice of Intent/Abbreviated Notice of Intent, or other) can be found here,<a href='/town-governance/conservation-commission/permit-filing-instructions'>Filing Instructions</a> .  Please review these documents and if you have further questions contact us at 781-316-3012 or<a href='mailto:concomm@town.arlington.ma.us'>concomm@town.arlington.ma.us</a>   \n<a href='/town-governance/all-boards-and-committees/conservation-commission/powers-and-duties'>Powers and Duties</a>   \n\n#### Frequently Asked Questions  \n#### What is a wetland?  \nLegally, the term wetland includes not only what we typically think of as wetlands, such as streams, ponds, and cattail marshes, but also areas such as wet meadows, red maple swamps, and intermittent streams that may be dry for a significant portion of the year. The technical definitions may be found in the Massachusetts<a href='http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/131-40.htm'> Wetlands Protection Act</a>  and its accompanying regulations, and for the most part are based on the occurrence of surface water and/or the abundance of specific wetland plants.  \n#### What is a floodplain?  \nA floodplain is an area that experiences surface flooding during storms. Two types of floodplain areas are protected under the state act. The more common areas are those bordering streams or ponds that flood during the 100-year statistical storm, which is the worst storm that can be expected to occur, on average, once every 100 years. The less common areas are isolated depressions that flood at least once a year to an average depth of 6\" and to a volume of one-quarter acre-foot (10,890 cubic feet).  \n#### What activities are regulated in wetlands and floodplains?  \nUnder the law, no one may \"remove, fill, dredge, or alter\" any wetland, any floodplain, or any land within 100 feet of a wetland without a permit from the Arlington Conservation Commission. The term \"alter\" is defined to include any destruction of vegetation, any change in drainage characteristics or flow patterns, or any change in the water table. Examples of activities requiring a permit include construction of a house, garage, shed, patio, or porch, filling to enlarge a backyard, installation of drainage ditches, and vegetation removal.  \n#### Why are wetlands and floodplains so important?  \nWetlands are afforded legal protection because they play an important role in environmental quality through: (1) protecting the groundwater and the private and public water supply; (2) controlling pollution by acting as a filter for removing sediments, nutrients, and other pollutants from runoff; (3) reducing storm and flood damage by providing areas to retain and store water; and (4) acting as habitat for fish and wildlife.  \nFloodplains are protected because they provide storage for floodwaters during storms. Any alteration to the land that reduces this storage capacity will displace floodwaters and cause greater flooding elsewhere. "

    "description": "#### Mission Statement  \nThe Town of Arlington recognizes its legal obligation and moral responsibility to provide Equal Employment Opportunity to its employees and potential employees.The Equal Opportunity Advisory Committee, a volunteer committee appointed by the Town Manager, is committed to the Equal Opportunity program to prevent discriminatory employment practices.  The Committee assists the Town in implementing its Equal Opportunity Plan that creates the mechanism and sets the standards by which Equal Opportunity will be assured.The Committee received and reviewed monthly reports from the Director of Personnel/Equal Opportunity Officer regarding the Town’s hires.  The principal focus of the Committee is to ensure that people of all races and ethnic backgrounds are given equal opportunity to apply for and receive positions of employment with the Town of Arlington.The Committee continues to try to increase the number of minority and female applicants for positions of employment by posting positions in publications that serve different minority communities in the area.  The Committee is always seeking new ways to improve outreach and welcomes input from any party who may have an idea about how to move forward in this goal.The Committee closely monitors all construction projects of over $200,000 to ensure that the Contractor and all sub-contractors are making a good faith effort to be in compliance with minority participation goals of the State and Town.  The Committee spearheaded the passage of a five percent female participation goal in town construction projects at the 1999 Annual Town Meeting and continues to be very concerned about the low rate of female participation on past projects.The Equal Opportunity Advisory Committee (EOAC) ordinarily meets at 7:30 P.M. on the second Wednesday of each month in the Town Hall Annex.   These meetings are open to the public and attendance is encouraged.Any person interested in the issue of Equal Opportunity Employment is encouraged to contact the Equal Opportunity Officer at (781) 316-3121 or<a href='mailto:cmalloy@town.arlington.ma.us'>cmalloy@town.arlington.ma.us</a> .  \n#### Links  \n<a href='https://www.arlingtonma.gov/Admin/Components/Page/EditDesign?navid=163'>Human Resources Department</a> <a href='https://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showdocument?id=9782'>Equal Opportunity Brochure</a> <a href='https://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showdocument?id=43042'>Equal Opportunity Plan</a>  "

Over 100 communities across the Commonwealth have enacted local historic districts to protect their historic resources and ensure the preservation of the character of their community.  \nArlington has seven established local historic districts that include over 300 properties that the community has recognized as unique resources worthy of protection.  The seven districts are: Avon Place, Broadway, Central Street, Jason/Gray, Mount Gilboa/Crescent Hill, Pleasant Street, and Russell.  The Arlington Historic District Commissions are required by law to review the architectural appropriateness of most proposed exterior design changes, whether they be a minor alteration, new additions, or removal of trim or structures.  The commissions consist of qualified volunteers appointed by the Select Board.  Each commission also includes a property owner or resident of each district, an architect, a real estate professional, and a representative from the Arlington Historical Society.  \nPlease note that the AHDC has jurisdiction of all properties located within a designated local historic district.  In addition to the seven local historic districts, a number of individual properties outside of the districts have been designated by Arlington as being historically and/or architecturally significant.  These individual properties outside the historic districts are overseen by the Arlington Historical Commission, not the Historic Districts Commissions.  \n#### Important Links  \n<a href='/title-vii-historic-districts'>Arlington Historic Districts Bylaw</a> <a href='/home/showdocument?id=29327'>Application for Certificate</a> <a href='/home/showdocument?id=46120'>Design Guidelines</a> <a href='/home/showdocument?id=9774'>Historic District Inventory Listing</a> <a href='/home/showdocument?id=9778'>Article 23: Enlargement of the Pleasant Street Historic District (PDF 4.1M)</a> <a href='/home/showdocument?id=9780'>Oak Knoll Final Report (pdf)</a> <a href='/town-governance/all-boards-and-committees/historical-commission'>Arlington Historical Commission</a>"

    "description": "  \n#### MISSION  \nThe Arlington Historical Commission (AHC) was established in 1970 to preserve and protect significant buildings within the Town that constitute or reflect distinctive features of the architectural, cultural, political, economic or social history of the Town. This work is described in the Town of Arlington Bylaws, Title VI, Article 6.    \nThe Commission is an advocate for historic preservation in Arlington, including working for historic preservation in planning and development for the community. The Commission maintains an inventory of historically and/or architecturally significant properties. It also administers the demolition -delay bylaw through formal public hearings and informal meetings with owners of inventoried properties. The Commission works with Town agencies on the maintenance and restoration of various town-owned historical buildings and gardens, including the Whittemore Robbins House and its outbuildings, the Winfield Robbins Memorial Gardens, The Town Hall and grounds, 23 Maple Street, and the Jarvis House at 50 Pleasant Street.  \nThe Commission meets the first Tuesday of each month at the Whittemore Robbins House. All meetings are open to the public.    \nOnly minutes the Historical Commission has approved are posted. All agendas, posted on the calendar, are subject to change until the scheduled meeting begins. The commission has an office in  the Whittemore-Robbins House.  \n<a href='http://www.arlingtonhistoricalcommission.org/'>Arlington Historical Commission</a> <a href='/home/showdocument?id=45715'>Historic Structures Inventory</a>"

    "description": "The<a href='/home/showdocument?id=30611'>Housing Production Plan (HPP)</a> was adopted by the Arlington Redevelopment Board and Select Board in summer of 2016. The Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development approved the HPP on November 7, 2016.  \nIn October 2015, the Town of Arlington engaged the Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC) to facilitate this work in conjunction with a Housing Plan Advisory Committee and the Department of Planning and Community Development (DPCD). The primary purpose of the resulting plan is to position the Town of first and foremost better meet local market-rate and affordable housing needs and demand, and in doing so work towards the Chapter 40B 10% statutory minimum. Towards that end, the Housing Production Plan consists of three major components: a housing needs and demand assessment; an analysis of development constraints, capacity, and opportunities in town; and an implementation plan consisting of housing goals and strategies to achieve them.  \nThe Housing Plan Implementation Committee (HPIC), formerly the Housing Plan Advisory Committee, was created by the Arlington Redevelopment Board on March 6, 2017. The Committee is tasked with implementing the HPP.  \n#### 2020 Activities  \nThe HPIC is currently working on advancing a Town Bylaw amendment to create a municipal Affordable Housing Trust Fund. A warrant article has been submitted for the 2020 Annual Town Meeting. Additional materials will be made available here as the bylaw amendment is developed.<a href='https://www.mhp.net/writable/resources/documents/MAHTGuidebook_2018.pdf'>A great resource to learn about municipal Affordable Housing Trust Fund's is the Massachusetts Housing Partnership's Guidebook on Trusts.</a>   \nMembers of the HPIC are also investigating the possibility of establishing a Real Estate Transfer Fee. There are many details that need to be discussed and the HPIC continues those conversations at their regularly scheduled meetings.  \n#### 2018 Activities  \nThe HPIC and DPCD thanks Pam Hallett of the Housing Corporation of Arlington, Chris Kluchman of the Massachusetts Housing Choice Initiative, Dana LeWinter of the Citizens' Housing and Planning Association, and Susan Connelly of the Massachusetts Housing Partnership for being panelists at the Housing Forum held on June 14, 2018, at the Arlington Senior Center. The four panelists presented information on the crucial need to increase housing production in Arlington and the greater Boston area as well as various tools and strategies that Arlington could use to achieve the goals outlined in the Housing Production Plan.<a href='/home/showdocument?id=43329'>View the presentation from June 14</a> .

    "description": "  \n\nArlington has as its mission to be a warm and welcoming community to all. Occasionally this mission is tested by human rights violations and/or a hate crime that may be directed at the whole community*. When Town leaders speak in unison, it sends a clear message to those who have been targeted that they are valued members of our community and that hate will not be tolerated. A unified response also helps dissolve confusion and misinformation while reinstituting calm.  \nIn order to provide a unified voice, a Response Coordination Team (RCT) has been formed under the auspices of the Arlington Human Rights Commission (AHRC). The RCT is chaired by the AHRC and is comprised of the Chief of Police, the Superintendent of Schools, the Town Public Information Officer, and representatives of the School Committee, Selectmen, the Diversity Task Group of Vision 2020, and local clergy.  \n In the event that a human rights violation affects the community at large, the RCT will convene in a timely manner to determine a course of unified action with the goal of preserving civil discourse and behavior in the Arlington community:  \nThe work of the RCT is but one vehicle the Town uses for addressing human rights violations. Many Town-based groups provide an array of services including educational forums, supporting the schools in addressing related issues, and ensure fair housing and employment practices.  \nIf you or someone you know has been a victim of a human rights violation, please refer to the Hate Crimes Resource Guide at arlingtonma.gov, or contact the Arlington Human Rights Commission at 781-316-3250 or<a href='mailto:info@arlingtonhumanrights.org'>info@arlingtonhumanrights.org</a> .  \n\n- Hate Crime: “Hate crime is the violence of intolerance and bigotry, intended to hurt and intimidate someone because of their race, ethnicity, national origin, religious, sexual orientation, or disability. The purveyors of hate use explosives, arson, weapons, vandalism, physical violence, and verbal threats of violence to instill fear in their victims, leaving them vulnerable to more attacks and feeling alienated, helpless, suspicious and fearful.” (U.S. Department of Justice Website on Hate Crimes)\r\n\n- Human Rights: “Human rights are rights inherent to all human beings, whatever our nationality, place of residence, sex, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, language, or any other status. We are all equally entitled to our human rights without discrimination. These rights are all interrelated, interdependent and indivisible.” (United Nations Human Rights, http://www.ohchr.org/en/issues/Pages/WhatareHumanRights.aspx)\n\n"

Its members discuss the financial impacts of annual increases in Town Departments, the School Department, and other expenditure budgets and of revenue forecast assumptions.  Its members track the balance and use of the Town’s Override Stabilization Fund and analyze the timing and size of possible future tax override votes.  The membership includes representatives from the Select Board, Finance Committee, School Committee, Capital Planning Committee, the Town Manager, School Superintendent, Town Treasurer/Collector, Town Comptroller, and other staff.  The presidents of the Town and School unions are invited to all meetings.  The Committee was established in 2004 in preparation for an operating override that year. The Committee meets, as needed, when the budget is being developed each fall and winter."

The grant allowed the Town to examine its strengths and vulnerabilities, as well as identify priority resilience-building actions. The grant process was coordinated by the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness core group composed of Town Officials, business leaders, and community members, and was led by Department of Planning and Community Development staff."

    "description": "The Open Space Committee (OSC) is a volunteer committee appointed by the Town Manager, with approval by the Select Board. The OSC is responsible for preparing and monitoring the Town’s Open Space and Recreation Plan, and the updated Plan for 2015-2022 is posted on this page.  \n#### Take A Walk  \n<a href='https://www.mapsonline.net/arlingtonma/takeawalk.html'></a> Welcome to Arlington's Take A Walk project. To encourage residents to get outside and walk to Arlington's diverse parks and recreational facilities, the Open Space Committee has developed a set of seven suggested and overlapping walking routes across town. The maps indicate safe walking distances linking open spaces, conservation lands, playing fields, playgrounds, and other points of interest.  \nA<a href='/home/showdocument?id=47709'>town-wide ma</a> <a href='/home/showdocument?id=47709'>p</a> shows all seven routes, or you can download or print any of the<a href='/home/showdocument?id=47707'>neighborhood maps</a>  - East Arlington North, East Arlington South, Arlington Center South, Arlington Heights South, Arlington Heights North, Arlington Center North, and Arlington Center Central.  \n#### Mill Brook Rediscovered   \nIn conjunction with the exhibit \"A Brook Runs Through It: Arlington's Mill Brook Legacy\", Arlington resident Glenn Litton wrote, directed, and produced a short video \"Mill Brook Rediscovered\". The exhibit was organized by and shown at the Old Schwamb Mill in Arlington Heights between September 2018 and June 2019. The exhibit and video document nearly 400 years of activity along the brook, from the first water-powered grist mill at what is now Cooke's Hollow through centuries of changing land uses to a look at the corridor today.  \nAn adapted version of the exhibit will be shown in the Town Hall Gallery, second floor, during the spring of 2020. Dates will be announced prior to the opening.  \n\n#### Experiencing Arlington's Open Spaces  \n<a href='https://arlingtonma.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapTour/index.html?appid=72a9ae0e47494ca8a38db869fc5b6d78'></a>   \nThis application presents an interactive inventory of Arlington's open spaces. It is intended to work in concert with the 2015 - 2022 Open Space and Recreation Plan. Arlington's natural environment is a precious and limited resource that has been difficult to acquire and maintain, and it needs to be protected ardently. Get acquainted with Arlington's open spaces through this application so you can go out and explore these places for yourself.  \n\n#### ACMi Interviews Open Space Committee Members  \n<a href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLztbi9KA9roXcy1HejLPWzyCz1Z_fot5b'></a>   \nAs part of its series, \"Million Dollar Gift,\" ACMi's James Milan interviewed three members of the Open Space Committee in a set of half-hour videos. The series celebrates and quantifies the contribution of volunteers on Arlington's committees and their impact on the community. Milan also interviewed John Ellis of the Tree Committee.<a href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLztbi9KA9roXcy1HejLPWzyCz1Z_fot5b'>View all four videos.</a>   \n<a href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLztbi9KA9roXcy1HejLPWzyCz1Z_fot5b'></a> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLztbi9KA9roXcy1HejLPWzyCz1Z_fot5b'>In Part 1 Ann LeRoyer, chair of the Arlington Open Space Committee, describes the work of the committee as one of many groups concerned about local open space and recreational resources. She explains the role of the</a> <a href='/town-governance/all-boards-and-committees/open-space-committee/open-space-plans/2015-2022'>Open Space and Recreation Plan</a> , currently covering the years 2015-2022, as a policy and planning document for the Town.  \nPart 2 focuses on John Pickle, a scientist, educator, and member of the Open Space Committee, who founded a unique program called Picture Post, whereby citizens can take pictures at designated locations as a way to track natural changes over time. John has installed several posts, with instructions, at sites around Menotomy Rocks Park and the Arlington Reservoir, and expects to posts at other locations in the future.  \nPart 3 features Kelsey Cowen and a discussion of the Committee's Take A Walk project, a relatively new effort to create safe and comfortable walking routes linking open spaces and other interesting sites all around town. The first routes focused on East Arlington, and other routes are being expanded through all neighborhoods. Watch for additional maps to be posted on this website.  \n#### Picture Post  \n<a href='https://picturepost.unh.edu/index.jsp'></a> Picture Post was founded in 2004 in Arlington by John Pickle and other members of the Friends of Menotomy Rocks Park. Picture Post is now part of Digital Earth Watch (DEW), a citizen science initiative developed with support from NASA to create opportunities for people to collaborate on environmental monitoring projects by sharing digital photographs from Picture Post sites.<a href='https://picturepost.unh.edu/index.jsp'>The database is housed at the University of New Hampshire.</a>   \nTake your digital camera or phone when you walk around Menotomy Rocks Park and the Arlington Reservoir, find the posts, and follow the instructions attached to them. Watch for announcements of additional locations planned for Spy Pond Park, the Minuteman Bikeway, and other sites. If you want to help with the installation of additional posts, or for more information, contact John Pickle (picklejohnmr@gmail.com).  \n<a href='/home/showdocument?id=40799'>Photographing Changes Around Arlington Reservoir</a> , by John Pickle  \n<a href='https://picturepost.unh.edu/gallery-newsletters.jsp'>Picture Post September 2017 Newsletter</a> , featuring Picture Post and Co-founder John Pickle recounts the beginning and how Picture Posts help shape his view of environmental change.   \n#### Statutory Authority  \nVoted at Town Meeting April 22, 1996:  That the Open Space Committee be appointed by the Town Manager subject to the approval of the Select Board.  Selection of members shall be consistent with the goals and objectives of the Arlington Open Space Committee and Recreation Plan.  The Open Space Committee shall recommend to each future Town Meeting the goals and objectives in Section 8 and implement the Action Plans proposed in Section 9 of the Open Space and Recreation Plan as well as such other action plans as the committee shall from time to time propose to Town Meeting.    \nCommittee members include representatives of the Park and Recreation Commission, Conservation Commission, Arlington Redevelopment Board, Vision 2020, and Department of Public Works, as well as several interested citizens. The committee generally meets on the fourth Thursday of the month at 7:30 pm in the Town Hall Annex.   \nContact: Emily Sullivan, Environmental Planner/Conservation Agent, Department of Planning & Community Development, 781-316-3012 "

Take the <a href='https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ArlingtonSTP'>Connect Arlington survey</a>  to share your input on various aspects of transportation and mobility in Arlington, including walking, bicycling, public transportation, driving, shared mobility, and micro-mobility.  \nThe Town is also seeking more targeted feedback on locations around Arlington where there are transportation concerns. Please go to this <a href='https://www.mapsonline.net/arlingtonma/sustainabletransportation_edit.html'>mapping application</a>  and tell us where transportation improvements are needed.  \n#### Background   \nThe 2019 Annual Town Meeting approved $80,000 to fund the creation of a Sustainable Transportation Plan (STP) for the Town of Arlington: $60,000 from town funds in the DPW budget and $20,000 from the Community Development Block Grant. The STP will provide a vision for the development of the transportation system in Arlington over the next 20 years, building upon the Traffic and Circulation section of the Master Plan and its recommendations. Goals and recommendations will be developed to prioritize next steps for projects, programs, and policies to achieve this vision. It will focus on all aspects of transportation and mobility in Arlington, including walking, bicycling, public transportation, driving, shared mobility, and micro-mobility.  \nIn January 2020, the town contracted with Nelson\\Nygaard Consulting Associates to complete the STP, and a kick off meeting was held on January 13, 2020.<a href='/home/showdocument?id=49861'>Nelson Nygaard's proposal is available to view.</a>   \nAs part of the development of the STP, the Town will conduct robust public outreach in the form of public forums, surveys, focus groups, and other methods.<a href='/home/showdocument?id=50599'>Read the Public Engagement Strategy for the plan.</a>   \nAny questions related to the preparation of the Sustainable Transportation Plan can be directed to Daniel Amstutz, Senior Transportation Planner, at<a href='mailto:damstutz@town.arlington.ma.us'>damstutz@town.arlington.ma.us</a> or at 781-316-3093.
