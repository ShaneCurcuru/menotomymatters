But is it real?   What is wrong with this picture?   Hint - count the utility poles.  Start with Pole A in front of Nicola's.  The hotel starts at around Pole B.  The circular driveway and canopy should be between Poles C and D.  Pole D, directly in front of the DAV building, marks the far end of the proposed hotel.  And the hotel is taller than those 40' utility poles. It is clear that the architects have provided a visualization that is grossly inaccurate, showing an undersized building that occupies only a fraction of the total footprint.

    "title": "The Heights Hotel Part IV - Is the Wait Over?",
    "preview": "The Heights Hotel Part IV - Is the Wait Over?     A QUICK RECAP on the \"Hotel Lexington\" project.  The last real news goes way back to July 22 when residents gathered in the Lyons Room to hear the proposal and provide their concerns.  The developer left with a long list of potential problems and zoning issues to resolve.  The Redevelopment Board was left with the thorny legal issue of waiving both special permit fees and future inspection fees.  Some of these fees are set down in our bylaws by Town Meeting but were somehow negotiated away by the Town Manager and the Planning Department.  Tomorrow's hearing will address the fairly modest $5400 special permit fee but leave unaddressed the substantial inspection fees which could easily top $100,000. After six months of cancelled hearings, the developer is back with a revised plan.  Most of the newly submitted material is about parking and traffic.  There will be no self-parking spots provided for either hotel guests or restaurant patrons.  All parking will be by valet.  The hotel is being pushed back about 12 feet to accommodate a small semi-circular driveway in front for pickup and drop-off.  This extra setback is a big improvement when viewed from the Mass Ave.  Not so good for the folks who live on Peirce St.  The back of the hotel will now be 12 feet closer to your backyards. The traffic study makes interesting reading.  For the before and after traffic estimates, the long abandoned Disabled American Veterans club is modeled as a high turnover sit down restaurant and is being counted for current traffic volume.  Apparently six years ago it had a small kitchen in the back. Environmentalists may be alarmed to discover that landscaped open space now means pervious brick rather than plantings. What is remarkable about the materials submitted for Monday’s hearing is not what is there but what is missing. Several serious zoning problems were raised at the July hearing but the applicant has chosen to completely ignore them, perhaps hoping that they will be forgotten.  Nothing has been done on the Clark St setback requirement. The planned upper story stepback continues to be a floor too high. And there still isn’t a single square foot of the required usable open space.  The developer continues to ask for an exemption from the floor area ratio requirements even though the bylaw explicitly denies the Board the authority to make such an exception for this size property.   And then there is the elephant in the room that no one will address - a hotel use is simply not allowed in a B2 zone.    The hearing is scheduled for Monday, January 27 in the Senior Center.  Hopefully the organizers have learned from last time and will arrange for microphones so that the public can hear what is being presented.  It would also be nice to have a projector and screen instead of flip charts so that we can actually see the drawings being discussed.",

    "title": "The Heights Hotel - History and Details",
    "preview": "1207 Mass Ave - Proposed Hotel Site  The Heights Hotel - History and Details  In our blog entry this week, we look at the hotel currently proposed at 1207 Mass Ave.    There is a meeting on this issue on July 22nd (this) Monday night  at the Arlington Redevelopment Board (ARB) session at the Town Hall Annex 2nd floor conference room. It was news to many Arlington residents this week that the Town was negotiating the development of a hotel on Mass Ave in the Heights.  Actually, it has been a long drawn out process that has not gone as first envisioned.  Here is the background story… It starts about six years ago when the Select Board discovered to its great surprise that it had owned the land at 1207 Mass Ave for more than a century and was landlord to the soon to be vacated Disabled American Veterans club.  A working group was formed, including Selectman Steven Byrne, to figure out what to do with this newly found asset. They looked first at ways to utilize it as a town building for office or meeting space.  They considered it for a food pantry site.  There was much talk of a shared space/incubator. They looked at rental options.  The Select Board concluded that the best option was to simply sell it outright and use the money to help pay for the Stratton School renovations.  They went before the 2015 spring Town Meeting with their case and received approval to dispose of 1207 Mass Ave. The optimistic view presented to Town Meeting was that the sale might realize $1M or more, and the 2016 fiscal year Capital Plan actually earmarked that amount for paying for Stratton School costs. Four years later, the funds from a sale have still not materialized. The first round of RFP bidding did not go well, with a few nibbles but no bids.  The Town lowered its asking price to $750K and in late 2016 received one offer from the owner of an abutting property. The Select Board had to deal with an awkward situation.  The sole bidder was James Doherty who had been on the Board of Assessors during the early days of the process.  He had purchased 1211 Mass Ave next door just a few years earlier, and the town lot was probably more valuable to him than other buyers because of the development possibilities.  His proposal was based upon the new mixed use bylaw passed by Town Meeting in 2016.  He proposed combining first floor retail with some sort of residential use above, specifying either apartments or a small hotel.  The latter was particularly attractive to the Select Board with its promise of revenue from hotel occupancy taxes.  Remarkably, no one seems to have noticed that the hotel use was prohibited in the B2 district of the DAV lot. The awkwardness of the sale arose from selling town land to an \"insider,\" a recent member of the Board of Assessors who also had a personal connection to a Selectman who had served on the working group exploring options for either keeping or selling the property.  The Select Board handled it with great delicacy.  Selectman Byrne properly recused himself quietly from deliberations and voting in March 2017, and the name of the buyer was not uttered during the meeting.  The Town Manager was authorized to enter into negotiations. The negotiations dragged out for a year and a half, finally concluding with a Purchase & Sale agreement last fall.  The buyer ended up with a very nice deal for himself, receiving a waiver of all special permit and building fees.  In appearing before the Redevelopment Board next week, he will not pay the approximately $5K fee set by the Board.  Going forward, he will not pay any building permit fees.   This is not chump change.  For a project of this size, the building permit fees will amount to many tens of thousands of dollars, likely topping $100K.  It is not clear that the Select Board or Town Manager even has the authority to waive these fees; they are set down in the Town bylaws.  It also seems that if the developer does not get the Special Permit he seeks, he can back out of the deal and the Town gets nothing for its efforts of the last five years. And that sets the playing field for next Monday’s hearing...",

Our source tells us that the ground-floor restaurant could actually be some sort of brewpub or tavern, though no specific details have been given as of yet; a hearing on the proposal is scheduled to take place on Monday, July 22, so more information on the dining/drinking spot (and the hotel) should be known by next week. The address for the DAV was 1207 Mass. Ave., while the address for Precision Tire and Alignment is 1211 Mass. Ave.; the two properties are about a block east of the Mass. Ave./Lowell Street fork. [July 23 update: A meeting at Town Hall last night gave some additional information on the proposal, including the fact that the plan is indeed to open an upscale restaurant on the main floor of the hotel, though the plans are in their initial stages for both the hotel and the restaurant, so things could change as more meetings take place.] by Marc Hurwitz (Also follow us on Twitter at @hiddenboston)  [A related post from our sister site (Boston's Hidden Restaurants): List of Restaurant Closings and Openings in the Boston Area]",
