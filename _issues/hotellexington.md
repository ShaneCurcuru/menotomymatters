**UPDATE** After no activity since August 2020, the developer has asked the ARB to re-open this docket in October 2023.

A developer is proposing to buy a town property and build a new boutique hotel and restaurant at [1211 Mass Ave](https://goo.gl/maps/95xGmZs5XVot72si8), between Leader Bank and the old Nicola's restaurant.  The proposal is complicated, involving the town selling a parcel to the developer (making money for the town) but pending an agreement on various [zoning approvals before the Redevelopment Board](/meetings/arb/).  You can follow along meeting minutes and news stories below.  Track this project's [Docket #3602 on my Redevelopment Board Meeting Tracker](/meetings/arb-index/#3602), or read my [preliminary blog post about the Hotel Lexington](/business/hotel-lexington/).
