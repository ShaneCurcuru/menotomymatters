Welcome to Menotomy Matters, Shane's website all about making town governance 
more transparent and easier to figure out for the average voter.

All original content is my own; I will link heavily both to the official 
Town of Arlington, MA website, as well as several reputable local news 
organizations.  I aim to provide both source documents as well as commentary 
on local issues.  I also host selected unofficial meeting notes from a 
handful of [local residents who take detailed notes during some meetings](/colophon).

I appreciate your feedback, so please do reach out if you have any 
factual corrections, or ideas of where to find useful information on 
the town website or elsewhere.  Many thanks to the Town government for 
improving their website's structured data after the pandemic!

## About Shane

A 20++ year resident of Arlington, Shane lives with his family and cats 
atop the Heights just under the water tower.  Our daughter enjoyed 
Robbins Farm Park and the Brackett School - especially Mrs. Z! - and 
made it through Ottoson too.  We love the feel of Arlington, and appreciate 
the wide variety of stores and restaurants that have grown up along 
Mass Ave - no longer do you need to go to Cambridge or Waltham 
for an awesome dinner out!

After a long career in software at IBM and a lot of volunteering in 
open source communities, I'm now taking a little bit of retirement 
early to work on meaningful projects.  Hence Menotomy Matters is my 
work to help the average voter more easily understand the workings 
of our town by making meetings, reports, and other things much easier 
to find and get explained.

Shane has a [professional resume site](https://shanecurcuru.org/) detailing his work in community management, and nonprofit governance.
