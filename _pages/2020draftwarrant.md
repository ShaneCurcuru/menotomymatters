The 2020 Annual Town Meeting is finally here after being [delayed due to the pandemic](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showdocument?id=51032).  By digging through the town website, and through the help of [Bob Sprague of Your Arlington](https://www.yourarlington.com/) I've compiled all articles and town board reports proposed for this delayed town meeting.

## Meeting Updates Due To Pandemic

Along with delaying the meeting, [Town Moderator announced significant changes](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showdocument?id=51032) to town meeting this year.  In particular, the moderator, in conjunction with town boards and various citizens who have submitted articles is planning to **defer** most non-financial warrant articles to a future meeting, as can be seen in the [Consent Agenda](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showdocument?id=51726).

**REMINDER:** these articles have manually transcribed from various submissions or the original draft warrant, and are **NOT OFFICIAL**.  The [official, final Town Warrant](https://www.arlingtonma.gov/home/showdocument?id=50436) is on the town website.
